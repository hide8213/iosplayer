iOS and OSX require extra care to make sure that only the AVPlayer in the
current application has access to the content in the clear.  To solve that
we use the resource loader to serve a random key.

InitializeEncryption calls SecCopyRandomBytes to create random bytes to build
a key on the fly to encrypt the output TS segments. An error will occur if
attempting to encrypt the output without calling InitializeEncryption first.

When building any m3u8 manifests GetKeyUrl returns the m3u8 text that must be
placed in the m3u8 as is.  It has the full line of text describing the key
and url with IV encoded.

Finally DashToHls_SetAVURLAsset needs to be called on all AVURLAssets need to
set up the AVResourceLoaderDelegate.  An optional
AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate can be passed in as |assetDelegate|.  This will
be called on all AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate not handled by the UDT.
